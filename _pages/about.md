I am a Ph.D. candidate in statistics at School of Statistics, Renmin University of China, advised by Professor Hanfang Yang. I visited Professor Qiang Sun at MBZUAI from Sept 2024 to July 2025. Prior to coming to RUC, I received a Bachelor of Science in statistics from Kuangyaming Honors School, Nanjing University in 2021. I grew up in Jinan, Shandong. 


I have a broad interest in machine learning with a particular interest in trustworthy machine learning topics, such as privacy and stability.
