I am a Ph.D. candidate in statistics at Renmin University of China, advised by Professor Hanfang Yang. Prior to coming to RUC, I received a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics with honor from Nanjing University in 2021. I grew up in Jinan, Shandong. 

I have a broad interest in general topics in machine learning with a particular interest in **statistical learning theory** and **differential privacy**. 

**Currently, I am actively seeking opportunities for research internships, visiting positions, or collaborations in these areas.**
