I am a Ph.D. candidate in statistics at [School of Statistics, Renmin University of China](http://stat.ruc.edu.cn/), advised by Professor [Hanfang Yang](http://stat.ruc.edu.cn/Home/People/Faculty/b3a208a052844c1e90df60c6e3f2f3d9.htm). Prior to coming to RUC, I received a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics with honor from [Kuangyaming Honors School, Nanjing University](https://dii.nju.edu.cn/main.htm) in 2021. I grew up in Jinan, Shandong. 

I have a broad interest in general topics of machine learning with a particular interest in **statistical learning theory** and **differential privacy**. My CV can be found [here](http://Karlmyh.github.io/files/CV.pdf).
