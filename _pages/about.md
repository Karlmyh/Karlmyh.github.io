I am a Ph.D. candidate in statistics at [School of Statistics, Renmin University of China](http://stat.ruc.edu.cn/), advised by Professor [Hanfang Yang](http://stat.ruc.edu.cn/Home/People/Faculty/b3a208a052844c1e90df60c6e3f2f3d9.htm). I visited Professor [Qiang Sun](https://sites.google.com/view/qsun/home) at Mohamed Bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence (MBZUAI) from Sept 2024 to July 2025. Prior to coming to RUC, I received a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics with honor from [Kuangyaming Honors School, Nanjing University](https://dii.nju.edu.cn/main.htm) in 2021. I grew up in Jinan, Shandong. 


I have a broad interest in machine learning with a particular interest in trustworthy machine learning topics, such as privacy and stability. My CV can be found here in [English](http://Karlmyh.github.io/files/cv_eng.pdf) and [Chinese](http://Karlmyh.github.io/files/cv_chinese.pdf).
